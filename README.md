# Perfect Number Checker in Python
This Python function determines whether a given integer is a perfect number. In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer equal to the sum of its proper divisors (excluding itself). For example, 6 is a perfect number because its divisors (1, 2, and 3) sum to 6.

Task
Write a Python function is_perfect(n) that:

Accepts a single integer, n.
Returns True if the number is perfect and False otherwise.
Hint
Define a helper function to check if one number is a divisor of another.
Use this helper function to find all divisors of the input number.
Purpose
This exercise helps practice:

Understanding and implementing mathematical concepts in code.
Working with loops and conditionals.
Defining and using helper functions to structure code logically and efficiently.
